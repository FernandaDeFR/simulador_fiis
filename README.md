# 📈 Brazilian Real Estate Funds (FIIs) Passive Income Simulator

## 🚀 Overview

The **Brazilian Real Estate Funds (FIIs) Passive Income Simulator** is a web-based application designed to help investors visualize, analyze, and plan their investments in FIIs traded on the B3 (São Paulo Stock Exchange).

This tool provides a clear interface for calculating crucial investment scenarios, allowing users to move from theoretical analysis to a practical investment strategy.

## ✨ Key Features

* **FII Data Visualization:** Display key financial metrics and information for various Real Estate Funds.
* **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Implement features to compare the performance and metrics of multiple FIIs simultaneously.
* **Passive Income Simulation:** Calculate the required initial investment and the time horizon needed to achieve a specific target monthly passive income based on historical dividend yields.
* **Technology Stack:** Developed using standard web technologies: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Goal

The main objective is to empower investors by demystifying FII investments. The simulator turns complex financial data (like dividend yield and distribution) into actionable insights, providing a clear path to achieving passive income goals.
